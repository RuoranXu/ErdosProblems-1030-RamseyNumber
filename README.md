# Erdos-Problems-1030-Ramsey-Number
This is just a very weak attempt from a UG-student.
The Ramsey number is one of the important functions in graph theory.

If $R(k,l)$ is the Ramsey number then prove the existence of some $c>0$ such that\[\lim_k \frac{R(k+1,k)}{R(k,k)}> 1+c.\]

A problem of Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s, who could not even prove whether $R(k+1,k)-R(k,k)>k^c$ for any $c>1$.
It is trivial that $R(k+1,k)-R(k,k)\geq k-2$. Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, and Shelp \cite{BEFS89} proved\[R(k+1,k)-R(k,k)\geq 2k-5.\]
