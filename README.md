# Erdos-Problems-1030-Ramsey-Number

The Ramsey number is one of the important functions in graph theory.
Code mainly fouces on lower bound estimation and proportional convergence.

If $R(k,l)$ is the Ramsey number then prove the existence of some $c>0$ such that\[\lim_k \frac{R(k+1,k)}{R(k,k)}> 1+c.\]
